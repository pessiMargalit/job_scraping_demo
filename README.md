## Scrapers
Need more scrapers?! No problem! You can easily add new scrapers to the project.
For more companies, you can visit: https://jlmtech.freshboard.city/companies and find those who have jobs.

### Creating new scrapers
Under the `Scrapers` folder you can find the Abstract classes (such as `Scraper`), and the next folder:
`CompanyScrapers` - contains the scrapers of the companies.

Every scraper is written by the same pattern:
```python
# exampleScraper.py
from Scrapers.Scraper import *


class exampleScraper(Scraper):
    name = 'exampleScraper'
    url = 'example.com'
    location = 'example' # default location, when not set its automatically 'Jerusalem'

    def scrape(self):
        # This is where you will write your logic to scrape the site example.com.
        pass
```

### Running the scrapers
To run a specific scraper you can just add `check_self()` to the end of the file, for example:
```python
# exampleScraper.py
from Scrapers.Scraper import *

class exampleScraper(Scraper):
...
# Same code as above

# This is the line you need to add to run the scraper:
exampleScraper().check_self()
```

Then you can run the file, and it will run the scraper and print the results.
